		<h2>Description</h2>
		<p>Snowball cookies are technically called Mexican wedding cakes or Russian teacakes, but my grandmother gave up on us calling them that years ago! With a rich, nutty flavor from finely chopped pecans, and a sweet, powdery coating from confectioners' sugar, these tiny, buttery treats are truly the most delicious melt-in-your-mouth morsels.</p>

			<li>1 cup unsalted butter, softened</li>
			<li>1/2 cup powdered sugar</li>
			<li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>

			<li>1 cup very finely chopped peacans</li>
			<li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
			<li>1/3 cup powdered sugar or more as needed</li>
		</ul>
		<h2>Steps</h2>
		<ol>
			<li>Beat the butter,powdered sugar, and vanilla</li>
